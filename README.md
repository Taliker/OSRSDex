OSRSDex is a school project for my android class that was supposed to let you make Old School Runescape equipment loadouts, fetch your up to date character levels and compare the damage output and input of each loadout. 

Turns out learning kotlin and the mvvm architechture took more time than expected so I didn't have time to finish it. 

It works but it doesnt really do much other than saving loadouts and fetching character levels
